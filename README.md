# üëü Sneakers Collection

**‚ö†Ô∏è Still a work in progress**

## What is it?

Sneakers collection is a simple Vue.js (powered by [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org)) open-source web app where you can see the next 10 sneakers releases of the most known sneakers brands ( Nike, Adidas, Puma, New Balance ...) in just a second on the home page. You can find sneakers by searching with the name, the brand, gender, the released year and even the exact released date.
All of these sneakers data are provided by the wonderful API of [The Sneakers Database](https://thesneakerdatabase.com/).

## Why?

As a series addict [TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com/) changed my life when it comes to knowing when a new seasons/episodes of my favourite shows are coming out and when I wanted to know what show I have already seen.
As a sneaker addict, I wanted to make the same thing for sneakers. With all the new releases every week it's not that easy to know what is coming out and when. So I wanted to know in a single place what is released and when. Make lists of my most wanted/favourite sneakers, know where I can buy at resell and at what estimated price, and see what is the **Sneakers Collection** of other sneakers passionate like me.

## Next Features

- A homemade GraphQL API.

  - Basic authentication (Username + Password).
  - SSO authentication (Connect with Apple, Twitter, Google).
  - Create lists of sneakers (Favourite, Wanted, Owned etc).
  - See profile with lists of other users.

- A much better UX/UI (I'm not very good at this, would love some help).
